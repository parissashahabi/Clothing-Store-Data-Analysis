# Clothing Store Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of the `cloth_final` dataset, which contains information and feedback about two clothing stores. The main objective is to perform comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The `cloth_final` dataset includes various attributes related to clothing items and customer feedback. Key features include `item_id` (indicating the type of product) and other attributes related to the size, specifications of the buyer, and their opinions about the purchase.

## Analysis Performed
The analysis includes several steps, each documented in the Jupyter Notebook file:
1. **Statistical Summary**: Describing the statistical information of the dataset.
2. **Missing Value Analysis**: Identifying and handling missing values in the dataset, along with justification for the chosen method.
3. **Box Plot Diagrams**: For numerical properties to visualize data spread and outliers.
4. **Distribution Plots**: For at least 3 features to understand their distribution.
5. **Category Diagram**: Based on length-feedback to show the frequency of each feedback in each category.

## Tools Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For plotting diagrams and visualizations.

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install necessary libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `DM-HW-1.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
